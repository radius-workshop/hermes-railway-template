# Hermes Agent — Project Instructions

## JWT / A2A Authentication

### Getting a Bearer token — the only correct method

Use the `generate_a2a_token` tool. It is registered as a first-class tool in this agent:

```
generate_a2a_token()
→ {"token": "<bearer_token>", "did": "<this_agent_did>"}
```

**If you are about to run `pip install ecdsa` or write any Python JWT signing code — STOP. Call `generate_a2a_token()` instead.** Every common Python library produces the wrong signature encoding for ES256K:

| Library / approach | Encoding produced | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `ecdsa` + `sigencode_der` or `sigencode_der_canonize` | DER | **403 Signature verification failed** |
| `pyjwt` called directly with raw key bytes | DER | **403** |
| `cryptography` library used directly | DER | **403** |
| `gen_jwt.py` (built-in) | IEEE P1363 (raw r‖s) | **200 OK** |

The auth server (`scripts/agent_server/auth.py`) uses `pyjwt` which expects IEEE P1363 encoding (raw 64-byte r‖s concatenation). DER-encoded signatures always fail, silently and in a hard-to-debug way.

The `generate_a2a_token` tool wraps this script. Its source for reference:

@file:/app/scripts/agent_server/gen_jwt.py

### JWT payload requirements

A valid JWT **must** include an `iss` claim containing the caller's `did:web` DID. Missing `iss` → `403 JWT missing iss claim`. The `gen_jwt.py` script sets this automatically from `PUBLIC_URL` / `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`.

### TRUSTED_DIDS configuration

For two Hermes agents to call each other, each must list the other's DID:

- **Agent A** env: `TRUSTED_DIDS=did:web:<agent-b-domain>`
- **Agent B** env: `TRUSTED_DIDS=did:web:<agent-a-domain>`

The DID is logged at startup and also available at `GET /.well-known/did.json` → `.id` field.

### Debugging auth errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `403 Signature verification failed` | Custom JWT code used DER encoding | Call `generate_a2a_token()` — never write JWT signing code |
| `403 JWT missing iss claim` | `iss` omitted from JWT payload | Call `generate_a2a_token()` — never hand-craft the payload |
| `403 DID not trusted` | Caller's DID not in `TRUSTED_DIDS` | Add the caller's DID to the remote agent's `TRUSTED_DIDS` Railway variable |
| `404 on /token` | Remote agent has no `JWT_API_KEY` set | Use DID JWT path (Option B) or ask operator to set `JWT_API_KEY` |
